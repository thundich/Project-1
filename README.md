## Analysis 
With the data provided, there are ample job opportunities locally here in the United States as well as abroad. In total, there were 8,128 jobs available. 6,956 jobs were available in the United States. Per the analysis, over 85% of the jobs were available in the United States.

With the map being provided, when analysis was run based on the Top 10 Countries, the top 10 countries actually changed based on either the company location or employee residence. Netherlands was number 10 when ran based on company location. However when analyzed based on the employee residence, Italy replaced the Netherlands. This data shows that even with populuous countries, the most jobs were shown to have been located in the Northern Hemisphere. The other variable difference was that even with the most populuous country, India, the average salary and average data scientist salary were lower compared to the other larger countries, such as Great Britian/United Kingdom and the United States. 
In the data, you will find the mean, median, mode and standard deviation of the top 20 countries. With the mode, there were many repeating numbers found, which could indicate that many employees had the same salary. 

Based on the data provided, the growth in data screince showed salaries were increasing by 5% each year. Between 2021 and 2022 had the largest increase of salary. Also in the same dataset, which is common with more knowledge and expertise, comes a higher salary pay for those with more experience. There is not much of a major change in salary range going from a Senior-level/Expert to a Executive-level/Director. 

Upon review of the analysis for the average salary and based on remote work, hybrid, or in office, there was not much difference in salary range between those that worked 100% remotely or those that worked in office. There was a major difference in salary though from those that worked partially remote and those that either worked fully in office or fully remote. Also the data analysis showed 99.7% were full time employees. 

Based on the company size, the medium and larger sized companies had the highest salary rates for employees. Overall, the United States had the highest salary rates based on company sizes then compared to their counterparts.
